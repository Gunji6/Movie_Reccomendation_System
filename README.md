# Movie Reccomendation System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using machine learning and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

# Stages of Development
## 1. Dataset Preparation
Utilized the TMDB 5000 movies dataset.
Preprocessed the raw dataset by:
Removing irrelevant columns.
Combining meaningful columns to create a consolidated feature set for recommendations.
## 2. Feature Engineering
Applied natural language processing techniques:
Bag of Words (BOW) for text representation.
Stemming and Lemmatization for text normalization.
Vectorization to convert textual data into numerical format.
## 3. Model Development
Built a content-based filtering model to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie attributes.
## 4. Web Application Deployment
Deployed the model using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
Enabled real-time recommendations for users based on input preferences.
## 5. Key Features
Interactive search and recommendation system.
Efficient preprocessing for clean and meaningful data representation.
